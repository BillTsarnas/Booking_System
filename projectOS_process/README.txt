BEFORE executing make:

-READ CAREFULLY the report.pdf

-Make sure you open a new terminal for the client execution

-IMPORTANT! Both in the server and client teminals, execute "clear", to clear the terminal output. Also, maximize the terminal windows if you want

-At the server terminal, execute make!!! Make will automatically compile the necessary files and start up the server

-At the client terminal, execute the run_tests script. Wait for a while until "theatre is full" messages start popping
(You may need to execute the script a second time, if the theatre is not full after the execution of the first)

-Shut down the server using ctrl-c. All the execution info will be displayed...

AFTER these,

-You can use make clean to delete all *.o and executable files, and then recompile all using make (remember to use "clear" before!)
